### Setting Colors

The **Selection Colors** panel (accessible from the toolbar) automatically detects all colors used in your design and provides powerful color management tools.

## Advanced Editing

## Responsive

### Breakpoints

#### Responsive Prefixes

Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes to target specific breakpoints:

- • `md:` Medium screens (768px+)
- • `lg:` Large screens (1024px+)
- • `xl:` Extra large (1280px+)

#### Breakpoint-Aware Controls

When editing in a specific device mode, visual controls automatically apply breakpoint prefixes. For example, changing font size in mobile mode adds `text-sm` while desktop keeps `text-xl`.

- Preview layouts on all devices
- Adjust typography for mobile readability
- Change layout direction (flex-col on mobile)
- Hide/show elements per breakpoint
