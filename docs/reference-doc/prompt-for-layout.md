Learn how to craft effective prompts for layouts and get better results with Aura's AI-powered design tools.

Well-structured layout prompts are essential for creating professional, responsive designs that work across all devices. This guide helps you create effective layout instructions for optimal results.

## Responsive Design

Creating effective prompts for responsive layouts that work well across all devices:

### Important Considerations

When requesting responsive layouts, be explicit about how elements should adapt. Don't just say "make it responsive" - specify exactly how the layout should change at different screen sizes.

### Common Responsive Patterns

## List Layouts

List layouts are among the most common and versatile UI patterns. They're excellent for displaying collections of similar items in a clean, scannable format.

### List Layout Best Practices

- • Maintain consistent spacing between list items
- • Use clear visual hierarchies to distinguish primary and secondary information
- • Consider adding dividers or alternating background colors for long lists
- • Ensure touch targets are at least 44px tall on mobile
- • Include clear feedback states (active, hover, focus)

## Grid Layouts

Grid layouts organize content in a structured, modular format that creates visual harmony and makes scanning information easier. Here's how to effectively prompt for different grid layouts:

### Effective Grid Layout Prompts

When requesting grid layouts, specify these important details:

- • Number of columns at different breakpoints (e.g., 4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet)
- • Gap sizes between grid items (e.g., 16px horizontally, 24px vertically)
- • Whether items should have equal heights or maintain aspect ratios
- • Any specific items that should span multiple columns or rows
- • Minimum/maximum sizes for grid items (especially important for responsive designs)

## Bento Layouts

Bento layouts (named after Japanese lunch boxes) feature a grid of content blocks with varying sizes and proportions, creating visual interest while maintaining structure. They're particularly effective for dashboards, portfolios, and content-rich home pages.

### Bento Layout Design Principles

- • Create a clear visual hierarchy with larger cells for more important content
- • Maintain spacing consistency between all cells
- • Use a grid system (4x4, 3x3, etc.) as the foundation
- • Keep the overall layout balanced, even with differently sized elements
- • Consider how the layout will collapse to a single column on mobile
- • Use subtle differences in styling to group related information

## Common UI Components

Key UI components are essential building blocks for any interface. Learning how to effectively prompt for these common elements will help you create cohesive and functional layouts.

### Component Design Best Practices

- • Maintain consistent spacing and sizing across all components
- • Consider accessibility needs with proper contrast and keyboard navigation
- • Design for touch targets on mobile (minimum 44px height)
- • Create clear visual feedback states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
- • Follow platform conventions when appropriate (iOS vs Android patterns)
- • Use subtle animations and transitions to improve usability

## Device Framing

Device framing places your designs within realistic device mockups, which is essential for presentations, documentation, and marketing materials. Here's how to craft effective prompts for different device frames:

### Device Framing Tips

1. Specify exact device models

"Frame this design in an iPhone 15 Pro" is better than "put this in a phone frame."

2. Request contextual elements

Include URL bars for browser frames or status bars with realistic time/battery indicators for mobile frames.

3. Add environmental context

"Show the iPhone on a wooden desk with soft lighting" creates more realistic mockups.

4. Consider angle and perspective

"Show the iPad at a slight angle (15°) with a subtle shadow beneath it" adds depth to presentations.

### Generated Prompt

Create a responsive layout for a website with a mobile-first approach. Include Navigation menu, Hero section.

The layout should stack elements vertically on mobile screens (below 640px) and expand to a multi-column layout on larger screens. Include a hero section at the top with a headline on the left and image on the right (stacking vertically on mobile).

Ensure all spacing and typography scales appropriately across different device sizes with appropriate breakpoints at 640px, 768px, and 1024px.

### Customization Tip

For even better results, you can further customize the generated prompt with specific details about your project, such as color schemes, typography preferences, or particular UI elements you need.

## Practical Examples

### E-commerce Product Page

### Mobile App Screen in Device Frame

### Personal Portfolio Bento Layout

### Layout Prompt Best Practices

For the most effective layout prompts:

- • Start with a clear overview of the layout structure
- • Specify dimensions or proportions where appropriate
- • Include responsive behavior for different screen sizes
- • Mention spacing, padding, and margins for consistent rhythm
- • Define the visual hierarchy and content organization
- • Reference specific style guidelines if available (colors, typography, etc.)
