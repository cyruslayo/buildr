Learn how to craft effective prompts for HTML generation and get better results with Aura's AI-powered design tools.

Well-structured prompts are the key to getting precise, usable output from AI tools. This guide will help you craft effective prompts for design and development tasks.

## HTML Generation Tips

Creating effective prompts for HTML generation can significantly improve your results. Here are some specialized tips:

1. Specify the framework or library

Mention whether you want vanilla HTML/CSS or a specific framework like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or Material UI.

2. Define the component structure

Outline the key elements you need.

3. Include responsive behavior requirements

Specify how your design should adapt to different screen sizes.

4. Reference a style guide or brand colors

Provide color codes or style information.

5. Mention interactive elements

Describe any animations or effects.

6. Provide a reference or inspiration

Point to existing designs.

## Hero Section Example

## Component Prompts

These templates are starting points. For best results, customize them with your specific design requirements.

Use these sample prompts as templates for common UI components:

### Hero Section

### Pricing Table

### Navigation Bar

### Testimonial Cards

## Responsive Design

Writing effective prompts for responsive designs:

## Device Framing

For more realistic mockups, request your UI to be framed within appropriate device containers:

### Pro Tip

When requesting device frames, include details about the device's environment to make mockups more realistic. For example, specify desktop wallpaper for browser frames, or add reflections and shadows to mobile devices.

### Framing Implementation Tips

1. Specify exact device models

"Frame this design in an iPhone 14 Pro" is better than "put this in a phone frame."

2. Request contextual elements

Include URL bars for browser frames or status bars with realistic time/battery indicators for mobile frames.

3. Add environmental context

"Show the iPhone on a wooden desk with soft lighting" creates more realistic mockups.

4. Consider angle and perspective

"Show the iPad at a slight angle (15°) with a subtle shadow beneath it" adds depth to presentations.

## Styling & Frameworks

Tips for specifying styling and frameworks in your prompts:

## Typography & Fonts

Typography plays a crucial role in UI design. Effective typography enhances readability, establishes hierarchy, and strengthens brand identity. Here's how to leverage modern fonts in your designs:

### Typography Fundamentals

When requesting designs, be specific about typography preferences including font family, weight, size, line height, and letter spacing. This ensures consistent, readable, and visually appealing text across your interface.

### Modern Web Fonts

Sans-Serif UI Fonts

Monospace

Serif

Display

### Typography & Fonts

Explore popular fonts and their typography guidelines for various design needs.

### Typography Prompt Builder

Use this interactive tool to craft precise typography prompts. Adjust the sliders to create the perfect typography instructions:

## Animation Techniques

Enhance your UI with these animation techniques that bring designs to life:

### Animation Examples

Note: Each demo uses CSS animations with different timing functions and properties to create unique effects.

### Animation Best Practices

Keep animations subtle and purposeful. Use the prefers-reduced-motion media query to respect user preferences for reduced motion. Aim for animations under 500ms for UI interactions to maintain responsiveness.

### JavaScript Visualization Libraries

Leverage powerful JavaScript libraries to create impressive visual effects with minimal custom code:

### Learning Tailwind's Design System

Understanding Tailwind's design systems will help you create more effective and consistent prompts:

#### Color System

Tailwind uses a numeric scale for color intensity, from 50 (lightest) to 900 (darkest).

#### Spacing System

Tailwind uses a consistent spacing scale where 1 unit equals 0.25rem (4px by default).

#### Typography Scale

Tailwind's font sizes range from text-xs to text-9xl, with standardized line heights.

#### Responsive Design Patterns

Learn Tailwind's breakpoint prefixes: sm, md, lg, xl, and 2xl.

## Vanta JS Example

## Layout Examples

These visual examples demonstrate common UI layout patterns you can request in your prompts:

When requesting layouts, specify details like spacing, corner radius, shadows, and interactions. For responsive designs, mention how layouts should adapt across different screen sizes.
