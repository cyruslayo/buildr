## Key Features

### Advanced AI Models

Access to premium AI models including Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro for superior design generation with thinking texts for clearer code reasoning, 4× larger output tokens for full landing pages in one shot, and instant image-to-HTML conversion.

### Multi-Page Sites & Publishing

Create multiple pages with element-to-page Links for navigation, add page transitions (fade, slide, scale, blur, push, wipe), publish to friendly subdomains with version updates, export full sites as HTML files, and export to Figma with organized layers intact.

### Templates & Components

Access 1000+ premium templates and 1400+ reusable components to jumpstart projects. Browse and remix full templates with all pages, replace elements instantly, create custom components, and share publicly with your team for faster collaboration.

### Code References with @

Reference templates, components, and code snippets using @ to add up to 100,000 characters of context (~2,000 lines of code) in a single prompt. Include multiple elements with Shift-click, reference previous chat iterations, and apply preset animations and effects instantly.

### Image Generation & Assets

Generate up to 4 image variations with Ideogram, Nano Banana, and Flux Kontext. Upload multiple images up to 10MB, access 20,000+ curated assets, remix visuals in Design Mode, instant image-to-HTML powered by GPT-5, and manage with improved attachment previews.

### Advanced Design Mode

Full-featured visual editor with Layers panel, Auto Breakpoints, measurement overlays for spacing, Command+Click interactive testing, 1400+ replaceable components, drag-and-drop editing, code snippets for animations and effects, and works on mobile devices for on-the-go design.

## Code References with @

### The Power of Context

Transform your workflow by referencing templates, components, and code snippets directly in your prompts. The @ symbol unlocks up to **100,000 characters of context**—roughly 2,000 lines of code—giving AI the exact ingredients it needs to create precisely what you envision. This is the difference between generic AI output and professional, consistent designs.

#### What You Can Reference:

- •**Full templates** - Reference entire landing pages (~31,000 characters) with all sections, styles, and scripts
- •**Components** - Individual elements like hero sections, navigation bars, cards, buttons, and forms
- •**Code snippets** - Preset animations, border gradients, progressive blur, alpha masks, and effects
- •**Previous iterations** - Reference earlier versions from your chat history to build upon
- •**Multiple elements** - Shift-click to select and reference multiple components at once

#### Real-World Example:

Instead of prompting:

"Create a landing page"

You can reference specific designs:

"Create a landing page using @hero-template-01 @pricing-cards @testimonial-section and apply the @border-gradient snippet"

This gives AI exact design patterns, maintaining consistency and professional quality across your entire project.

#### Pro Tip

Start with a base template, then reference specific components to customize it. This approach creates professional designs in minutes that would normally take hours to build from scratch.

## Figma Integration

Aura offers seamless integration with Figma through two powerful methods that allow you to import designs from Figma and export your Aura creations back to Figma.

### Import from Figma

1. Open your design in Figma

Navigate to the frame or component you want to import into Aura.

2. Select the element and use "Copy link to selection"

Right-click on your selection and choose "Copy link to selection" or use the share button and copy the link.

3. Paste the URL in Aura

In Aura, use the "Import from Figma" option and paste the copied URL to import your design elements.

4. Confirm that you have the correct design

Aura will process your Figma design and show you a preview. If you see your entire page, make sure to right-click the frame / Copy/Paste as / Copy link to selection. Do not use Command + L.

### Export to Figma

1. Select your design in Aura

Choose the element or frame you want to export to Figma.

2. Use "Copy Console Code" feature

In Aura's export menu, select "Export to Figma" and click "Copy Console Code".

3. Open Figma and access the Console

In Figma, open the document where you want to place the design. Open the browser's developer console (Command /, search console. Click Show/Hide console).

4. Paste and execute the code

Paste the copied code into the console and press Enter. The code will create your Aura design in Figma, preserving styles and structure. For the first time, you'll need to type "allow pasting" in the console.

## Exported From Aura

Figma designs generated and exported from Aura:

### Viewing Tips

- Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the design
- Hold spacebar and drag to pan around the canvas
- Click on elements to see their properties and styles

## Why Aura?

In today's fast-paced design world, efficiency is key. Aura was built to address common pain points in the design workflow:

1. Time Efficiency

Reducing time spent on repetitive design tasks allows you to focus on creativity and problem-solving.

2. Design-Dev Collaboration

Bridging the gap between design and development with code generation and seamless handoffs.

3. Rapid Prototyping

Enabling rapid prototyping and iteration to quickly test and refine design concepts.

4. Community Sharing

Share your designs with the community and build upon existing templates to accelerate your workflow and inspire others.

## Effective Prompting

Well-structured prompts are the key to getting precise, usable designs from Aura. The more specific your instructions, the better the output you'll receive.

The key to getting the most out of Aura is crafting effective prompts. Well-structured prompts lead to better AI-generated designs and code.

### Prompt Structure

Be specific about what you want, including:

- Framework preferences (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
- Component structure and layout
- Color schemes and styling details
- Responsive behavior requirements
- Interactive elements and animations

### Examples

Basic prompt (less effective):

Detailed prompt (more effective):

### Sample Prompts to Try

Referencing existing design systems and using device framing can dramatically improve your results. Brand-inspired styling creates familiarity, while device framing helps visualize how designs will appear in real-world contexts.

#### Hero Section

#### Navigation Bar

#### Mobile Responsiveness

#### Brand-Inspired Styling

#### Using @ to Reference Templates

#### Prompt-Targeted Edits

#### Pro Tip

For complex designs, try a stepwise approach: Start with a basic structure, then refine in subsequent prompts by adding specific details, styling, and interactions.
