## 1. Primary Persona: Chibuzo Okeke

### Marketing Manager at Lagos Real Estate Agency

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Age** | 32 |
| **Location** | Lagos, Nigeria (works in Lekki, lives in Ajah) |
| **Company** | Prime Properties Limited (18 agents) |
| **Role** | Marketing Manager |
| **Tech Comfort** | Intermediate (uses Canva, Instagram, WhatsApp Business) |
| **Budget** | ₦30,000–₦50,000/month for marketing tools |
| **Primary Device** | iPhone 13, occasionally laptop |
| **Internet** | 4G mobile data, occasional WiFi |

### Background

Chibuzo handles all marketing for Prime Properties, a growing agency in Lekki. He manages Instagram, creates listing posts in Canva, and coordinates with freelance designers for landing pages. Most leads come through WhatsApp, and he spends hours responding to "Is this still available?" messages.

### Goals
- Create landing pages quickly for new property listings
- Generate more qualified WhatsApp leads (not just "price please?")
- Make the agency look as professional as the big players like Landwey
- Reduce time spent on back-and-forth messaging
- Enable agents to share professional pages instead of Instagram posts

### Pain Points
- Current designer charges ₦80,000–₦150,000 per landing page
- Takes 5-7 days to get a single page done
- Pages don't work well on mobile (90% of their audience)
- No easy way to add WhatsApp buttons
- Templates on Wix don't understand Nigerian property types
- Has to manually convert sqft to sqm for every listing

### Quote
> "I post a new listing on Instagram and get 50 DMs saying 'price?' and 'location?'. If I had a proper landing page, people would get the info first and only serious buyers would message me."

### Tech Stack
- **Design**: Canva Pro
- **Communication**: WhatsApp Business, Instagram DM
- **Email**: Gmail (rarely used for leads)
- **Ads**: Instagram/Facebook ads
- **CRM**: Excel spreadsheet
- **Website**: WordPress (rarely updated)

### A Day in Chibuzo's Life

1. **8:00 AM** - Checks WhatsApp for overnight inquiries
2. **9:00 AM** - Posts new listing on Instagram
3. **10:00 AM** - Gets 20 DMs asking for price/location
4. **11:00 AM** - Sends same info to each person individually
5. **2:00 PM** - Tries to create landing page in Canva (gives up)
6. **4:00 PM** - Sends brief to freelance designer
7. **5:00 PM** - More WhatsApp inquiries
8. **9:00 PM** - Still responding to messages

### What Would Delight Chibuzo
- Generate a page in 5 minutes that he can share via WhatsApp
- Page automatically shows price, location, and photos
- WhatsApp button pre-filled with property name
- Mobile-perfect design
- Naira pricing that looks professional (₦85,000,000)

## 2. Secondary Persona: Fatima Bello

### Independent Real Estate Agent in Abuja

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Age** | 38 |
| **Location** | Abuja, Nigeria (Wuse II) |
| **Company** | Independent (under Remax) |
| **Role** | Sales Agent specializing in residential |
| **Tech Comfort** | Low-Medium (WhatsApp expert, struggles with tools) |
| **Budget** | < ₦10,000/month for tools |
| **Primary Device** | Samsung Galaxy, Android |
| **Internet** | 4G data, sometimes slow |

### Background

Fatima left banking 5 years ago to pursue real estate. She's built a strong network in Abuja's high-end market (Maitama, Asokoro) through referrals. She doesn't have a website—all her business comes through WhatsApp and word-of-mouth. She wants to look more professional but doesn't know where to start.

### Goals
- Create a professional bio page to share with new contacts
- Quick property pages for her listings
- Look as professional as agents with big marketing budgets
- Spend minimal time on tech—focus on selling

### Pain Points
- No website or landing pages—just WhatsApp status
- Tried Wix once, got confused after 2 hours
- Can't afford a designer (quoted ₦200,000)
- Her current "listings" are just photos sent via WhatsApp
- Competitors with Canva graphics look more professional

### Quote
> "I close deals worth ₦500 million a year, but I don't even have a proper page. When I send clients my WhatsApp status, it doesn't look professional. I need something I can share that makes me look like a top agent."

### What Would Delight Fatima
- Say "Create a page for 5 bedroom duplex in Maitama, ₦450M" and get a page
- Share link directly to WhatsApp contacts
- Bio page with her photo and credentials
- Zero learning curve
